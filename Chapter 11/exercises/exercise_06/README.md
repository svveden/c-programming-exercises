### Exercise 11.06
Write the following function:

```c
void find_two_largest(int a[], int n, int *largest, int *second_largest);
```

When passed an array `a` of length `n`, the function will search `a` for its
largest and second-largest elements, storing them in the variables pointed to by
`largest` and `second-largest` respectively.
