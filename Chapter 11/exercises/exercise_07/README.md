### Exercise 11.07
Write the following function:

```c
void split_date(int day_of_year, int year, int *month, int *day);
```

`day_of_year` is an integer between 1 and 366, specifying a particular day
within the year designated by `year`. `month` and `day` point to variables in
which the function will store the equivalent month (1-12) and day within that
month (1-31).
