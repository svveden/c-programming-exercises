### Project 1.02
Write a program that computes the volume of a sphere with a 10-meter radius,
using the formula v = 4/3πr³. Write the fraction 4/3 as `4.0f/3.0f`. (Try
writing it as `4/3`. What happens?) Hint: C doesn't have an exponentiation
operator, so you'll need to multiply r by itself twice to compute r³.

## Project 1.03
Modify the program of Programming Project 2 so that it prompts the user to enter the radius of the sphere

1.02 and 1.03 are both here.
