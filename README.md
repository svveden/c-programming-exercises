# C Programming: A Modern Approach

These are my solutions to certain practice projects and exercises from C Programming: A Modern Approach by K.N.KING. This repo is for me to keep my solutions and show experience with C. My answers are definitely not bullet proof, but they should solve the problem given.

Update 03/13/2022: As of March 13, 2022 I have finished C Programming: A Modern Approach. My posted solutions to the books practice questions are not entire complete, due to some of the repetitiveness of the questions or time constraints I skipped some programming projects in many of the chapters. As this github repo isn't meant as a solutions repository, but just an area for me to save my C work and gain some experience with C, I have no current plans on going back and 100% the book. I've also skipped many, if not most, of the "exercises" listed in the book due to the fact that most of them are multiple choice questions or questions on an idea with no coding required, thus I didn't have a reason to put it on here. I am slowly working through my posted chapters and adding the questions in readme.md files to give a better understanding to future readers what the code hopes to solve. Lastly, I have no solutions for some of the last chapters in the book, this is mainly due to the fact that the last few chapters have to do with international porting, uncommonly used math.h functions, or functions used a lot in previous chapters.
