### Exercise 8.05
The Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ..., where each number is the
sum of the two preceding numbers. Write a program fragment that declares an
array named `fib_numbers` of length 40 and fills the array with the first 40
Fibonacci numbers. *Hint*: Fill in the first two numbers individually, then use
a loop to compute the remaining numbers.
