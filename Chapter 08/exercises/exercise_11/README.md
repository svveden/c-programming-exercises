### Exercise 8.11
Write a program fragment that declares an 8 x 8 `char` array named
`checker_board` and then uses a loop to store the following data into the array
(one character per array element):

```
B R B R B R B R
R B R B R B R B
B R B R B R B R
R B R B R B R B
B R B R B R B R
R B R B R B R B
B R B R B R B R
R B R B R B R B
```

*Hint*: The element in row i, column j, should be the letter `B` if i + j is an
even number.
