### Exercise 17.12

Write the following function:

```c
struct node *find_last(struct node *list, int n);
```

The `list` parameter points to a linked list. The function should return a
pointer to the *last* node that contains `n: it should return `NULL` if `n`
doesn't appear in the list. Assume that the `node` structure is the one defined
in Section 17.5
